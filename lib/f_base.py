#This is a compilation of all of the forecast basics. These are functions
#   that will commonly be used in forecast models. They are here because
#   I had all of my forecasts here and it got too big.

#df = data frame of stock inputed
#f_len = # of days inputed
#var = relevant column inputed, Ex: 'Adj Close', 'Open', ect...

'''
Pre-processing operations:
    Operations which take the raw data frame and modify it in such a
    way that it is more convient to use for data analysis. Alpha and
    Beta are both very simple and could be lambda functions. However,
    I put them here. This is so that the values scale for all forecasts.
    Possibly making the code more flexible for user input for alpha and
    beta.

Post-processing Operations:

    pulled from today because otherwise bussiness days work in a super
